## Projects (select)

- **AI Resume Evaluator (RAG)** — Built a resume evaluation tool using semantic embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to compare candidate resumes with job descriptions and produce recruiter-style insights. Tech: Python, FAISS, Embeddings, LLM APIs, Streamlit.

- **Fake News Detection System** — NLP pipeline with TF-IDF features and supervised classifiers to detect misinformation. Deployed as a simple Streamlit app; evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1.

- **E‑Commerce Sales Prediction** — Time-series / tabular model predicting marketplace sales using feature engineering and tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). Built visual dashboards for decision support.

- **LLM Text Summarizer** — Command-line + REST API summarizer leveraging LLMs for concise, high-quality summaries. Tech: Python, Flask/FastAPI, LLM APIs.
